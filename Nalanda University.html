  <p>
    <b>Nalanda University</b>, located in Bihar, India, is one of the world’s oldest and most renowned centers of learning. Established in the 5th century CE during the Gupta Empire, Nalanda attracted scholars and students from across Asia, including China, Korea, and Central Asia. It was a thriving hub for intellectual exchange and spiritual growth for nearly 800 years.
  </p>
  <p>
    The university featured a sprawling campus with impressive architecture, including monasteries, lecture halls, libraries, and hostels. It is said to have housed over 10,000 students and 2,000 teachers at its peak. The **library**, known as Dharma Gunj (Mountain of Knowledge), was one of the largest in the ancient world, containing texts on philosophy, science, astronomy, medicine, and Buddhist scriptures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nalanda’s curriculum was vast and diverse, blending Buddhist teachings with subjects like logic, mathematics, grammar, and arts. Scholars like **Xuanzang** and **Yijing** documented their experiences, highlighting the university’s role as a global center of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    The university’s decline began with the invasions of the 12th century, which led to its destruction. However, in modern times, the government of India has revived Nalanda University as an international institution, honoring its legacy as a beacon of knowledge and cultural exchange.
