    The <b>Hawa Mahal</b>, or "Palace of Winds," is an architectural gem located in the vibrant city of Jaipur, Rajasthan. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, this five-story pink sandstone structure stands as an iconic symbol of Rajput heritage. Designed by architect Lal Chand Ustad, the palace is renowned for its unique facade comprising 953 intricately carved windows, or jharokhas.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary purpose of the Hawa Mahal was to allow royal women to observe daily life and festivals on the streets below without being seen, adhering to the principles of purdah. The jharokhas not only provided privacy but also facilitated natural air circulation, keeping the interiors cool during Rajasthan's scorching summers, hence the name "Palace of Winds."
  </p>
  <p>
    The structure is a stunning blend of Rajput and Mughal architectural styles. While the domes and floral patterns showcase Mughal influences, the sharp spires and carvings reflect traditional Rajput design. The Hawa Mahal is part of Jaipur’s City Palace complex and is located near other historical landmarks, making it a favorite among tourists.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, the Hawa Mahal stands as a testament to the ingenuity of Indian craftsmanship and Jaipur’s regal past. Visitors can climb to the top floors for a panoramic view of the bustling city and immerse themselves in the rich history that surrounds this magnificent structure.
